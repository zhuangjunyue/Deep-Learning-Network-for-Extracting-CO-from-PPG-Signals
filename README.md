# Deep-Learning-Network-for-Extracting-CO-from-PPG-Signals
This project involves predicting Cardiac Output (CO) from PPG (Photoplethysmography) signals collected experimentally. It includes processing of PPG signals for feature extraction, developing a CO prediction model using deep learning, implementation on DE10 NANO hardware, and designing a QT interactive interface
